# Stremio Japanese Subtitle Addon

This plugin aims to bundle various online readily available Japanese subtitle sites for movies and series and supply them to stremio.

## How it works

Depending on the type of show the plugin will look up common hosting sites for subtitles and download them to the locally deployed server.
If nothing was found then no subs will be downloaded. 


## Installation Guide 

Since the database of subtitles is quite large it is not committed to GitHub. One can download the database and add it to the dummy folder in this project when hosting. 
The server will log if the installation of sub files was successful or not.
